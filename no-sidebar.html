								<h2><a href="#">TEDx Experience</a></h2>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/tedx-full.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								My TED Talk started out with a game, I yelled out names of famous scientists who have achieved amazing
								things, for example, "Albert" and they'd reply with "Einstein", not surprisingly, they were stuck on
								when I yelled out female scientists first names. From this, my talk majored on four key issues that cause the 
								gender gap. I wanted to make sure to not leave on a problematic note, so I issued "What can a student do?", "What can a parent do?"
								and "What can an organization do?" adding to what the audience can do as an individual or family member.

									<h3>Why am I passionate about this issue?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									Robotics has been my passion since I was seven years old. When I was finally old enough to join a team,
									I noticed that I was one of three girls in my whole robotics team, the following year, I was one of two, and my recent
									year of doing robotics: I was the only girl. I was scared, I didn't want to do it anymore. I cried to my parents that
									I don't feel comfortable, and I feel less confident. That's when I recieved a voice note from my mentor, who was also
									the coach of my team, who reminded me that I can take this as a challenge. 
								</p>
								<p>
									That's when it hit me, instead of being afraid and giving up, I can advocate. It's not the boys' fault that there are no girls,
									and it's not girls' fault that they weren't on the team. It all came down to a simple issue. 
									<br>

									<h3>Why is this happening?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									When you go to a famous AI chatbot, and ask them for birthday gifts for girls and boys. You will see that it recommends rocketships,
									space legos, science experiments for boys, and barbies, dreamhouses, and princess dresses for girls. Now this isn't wrong, but why can't That
									princess wear an astronaut suit? Does she always have to wear a pink dress?

									Society is picturing boys to pursue certain careers and girls to pursue certain careers. We need to change that.

									<br>
									<br>

									That's why I have spoken in numerous confrences about breaking barriers. TAKE A LOOK!

									<h3><a href="#">Tamil Women Rising</a></h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I spoke at tamil women rising, an amazing organization for south asian women to share their experiences, their roadblocks,
									and how they overcame them. I had such an amazing time meeting so many young girls and women who are from my ethnicity
									who are proud of my work and share their powerful messages. I spoke about my experiences as a south asian young student
									in the STEM industry including my roadblocks.

									<h3><a href="#">International Day of Girl</a></h3>

								<p>
									I was invited to be a panelist by the non-profit: Skills Ontario to talk about how seeing women in the Skilled
									Trades inspire me, and how they motivate me to do more. I talked about why I wanted to pursue a field in the space industry,
									and my past experience seeing barriers at such a young age.
