										<h2><a href="#">COVID-19</a></h2>
										<p>
											How COVID taught me more about STEM.
										</p>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/firstcamp.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										When I go to school, the teachers there would always inspire me. Not from their way of teaching, but from their way of patiently explaining.
										I can't imagine having 23 kids who have a very short attention span. But little did 9-year-old me know that one day, I'd become a teacher. This new passion began when,
										one day I was talking to my little cousin who was only five at the time, and I was trying to explain to him how to use Scratch, a platform I adored.
										My mom noticed it, and asked me, "Do you want to teach kids about coding?", I thought the idea was crazy, but I nodded my head anyways. It'd be cool to teach people my own age about this.
										It's only for a month, it'll be fun.
									</p>

											<h3>Running Coding Camps</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											My very first camp was in the summer of 2020, the peak of COVID-19 season. Almost all of my moms' friends' kids joined the camp.
											It was a mess, it was with kids of all ages ranging from 6 to 14, and me, a 9-year-old who was practically younger than most of the kids,
											was teaching them about Scratch, a platform I had mastered in. To this day, I don't know how I handled that camp. I ran it for two months too.
											Besides the chaos, I LOVED IT. It was so fun, and even I learned a few things about Scratch. 
										</p>
										<p>
											I wanted to continue this hobby, so every single holiday break, I would make a flyer, and I even expanded it to HTML, CSS, space, PYTHON, JavaScript, AI&ML, and more.
											Soon, it went from my moms' friends' children to students all over the world. It was so amazing. 
										</p>

											<h3>Where am I now?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											To this day, I have taught over 500+ kids in countries USA, Canada, India, South Africa, United Kingdom, Nigeria, and Australia about
											numerous programming languages and space including in non-profit organizations and in my own holiday camps.
